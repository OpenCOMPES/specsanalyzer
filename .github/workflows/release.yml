# Workflow runs prerelease job on every push to main branch
# and a release job on every tag push.
# A publish job is executed on every successful prerelease or release job
# And if publish is successful, the version is also updated in the pyproject.toml file and pushed to main branch
  # Workflow does not trigger itself as it only changes pyproject.toml, which is not in paths for this workflow
# The package is distributed as sed-processor
